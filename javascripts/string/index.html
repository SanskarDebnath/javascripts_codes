        “The exact cause of the accident remains under investigation, but initial probe suggest that the incident was caused because of low visibility due to fog,” PTI quoted DL Nagesh, Chikkaballapur Superintendent of Police, as saying.
        
        In another tragic incident in Karnataka, three differently-abled children, including two brothers, were run over by a suburban train near Urapakkam on the city’s outskirts on Tuesday, October 24.
        
        The three, aged between 11 and 15, were from Karnataka. They were run over by the train while crossing the track, police said.
        
        “Of the three, the two brothers were deaf and dumb while the third one could not speak,” a police officer said. Their parents were daily wage earners in Chennai.
